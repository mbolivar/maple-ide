- preprocessing steps (in the java version)

    1. cat all the .pde files together.  mark each file with its line
       offset in the big file.

    2. headerOffset = PdePreprocessor#writePrefix
        2.1. optionally subsitute unicode
        2.2. get default imports
        2.3. figure out program imports
        2.4. figure out prototypes (PdePreprocessor#prototypes)
        2.5. return number of lines of: headers, prototypes needed

    3. main file name = PdePreprocessor#write. writes to file:
       3.1. headers and prototypes from 2
       3.2. catted program
       3.3. contents of appropriate main.cxx based on build.core value

    4. add to "class path" and "library path" (!@#$) the paths to
       the locations of any imported libraries.

  may use the following combination of styles: wxDEFAULT_FRAME_STYLE &
  ~ (wxRESIZE_BORDER | wxRESIZE_BOX | wxMAXIMIZE_BOX)"
