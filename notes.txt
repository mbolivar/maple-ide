* preprocessing steps

1. cat all the .pde files together.  mark each file with its line
   offset in the big file.

2. headerOffset = PdePreprocessor#writePrefix
    2.1. optionally subsitute unicode
    2.2. get default imports
    2.3. figure out program imports
    2.4. figure out prototypes (PdePreprocessor#prototypes)
    2.5. return number of lines of: headers, prototypes needed

3. main file name = PdePreprocessor#write. writes to file:
   3.1. headers and prototypes from 2
   3.2. catted program
   3.3. contents of appropriate main.cxx based on build.core value

4. add to "class path" and "library path" (!@#$) the paths to
   the locations of any imported libraries.

5. copy any .c, .cpp, .h files into the build directory directly.  for
   every .pde file, add the header offset to its previously computed
   preproc offset (since we dumped headers first)
