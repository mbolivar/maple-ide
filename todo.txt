General TODO notes on the IDE rewrite.

- too many die()s around; figure out a better way to get errors to
  user so they can make a decision.  probably merge wx_util and util
  interfaces.

- consider unifying Sketch and sketchbook; the current thing is
  starting to feel stupid

MIGRATION
---------

- need to build a migration utility which imports preferences from old
  IDE and from Arduino

TABS
----

- tabs show you when they have unsaved information
- new tab icon
- don't let tabs close? or do something clever if they _do_ close?

MENU
----

- undo/redo/cut/copy/paste should be grayed out as appropriate
- need to have the app not be "Python" (probably requires building a .app)

TOOLBAR
-------

- mouseover support
- text listing what the button does should appear

RESOURCES
---------

- reference directory needs to get more brains
- the examples directory in our current build has examples you can
  save to.  this is wrong, and should not be true in the builds of the
  new IDE.

MAC
---

- either persist the application after the last frame has been closed,
  or prompt the user if they're sure when destroying the last frame

KEYBINDINGS
-----------

- "quit" keybinding (CMD-Q on OS X e.g.) is wrongly mapped to "close" action

CPPStyledTextCtrl
-----------------

- add brace/paren matching
- need to place the cursor inside of the active page during frame startup

PREFERENCES
-----------

- configurable tab-width
- LIB_MAPLE_HOME env var override
- unicode substitution in preproc
- imports
